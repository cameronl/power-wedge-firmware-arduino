Drive speed (degrees/ms)?
Noise on analog read?
 - Low pass filter (passive or active)
 - Analog front end?
 - VREF
 - Keep analog ground away from relay ground
 - Take multiple readings and average/median.
ms per loop?
Shielding?
Log of relay cycles
 - Up relay cycle count
 - Dn relay cycle count
 - time on?
Settled duration: Time between relay activations.
Delay between opposite relay on (to ensure both not on at the same time).
Prohibit both relays on at the same time.
 - Software vs hardware?
Can both relays be on at the same time with slow relay turn off?
What exactly happens with both relays on at the same time?
 - Nothing?
 - Battery short?
 - High current?
MCU pins high during reset/setup? Don't want (esp. both) relay pins high during bootup.
Log of PID output
Command response duration: Time between setpoint change and settled start.
Drive duration: Sum of time while relay on
 - Up relay
 - Dn relay
12V battery monitor
 - Voltage
 - Current?
Rates
 - Movement rate: degrees/ms
   - There is a delay after relay turn on.
 - Relay cycle rate: count/s
Detect no movement?
 - At limit
Movement rate vs. expected rate?
Minimum relay on time?
 - Relays take time to turn on/off. Don't try to move again if relay recently turned off.
 - Can we detect when a relay turned off after a turn on?

Unexpected movement is bad. Sources of unexpected movement:
 - Bad angle sensor input
 - Tolerance near error
 - Error flags which clear after a while or on MCU reset
 - Set point changes

Handle limits
Manual movement
 - Any use? Fallback.
 - Or to get back from beyond limits?

Option/config to disable checking for each error class.
Option/config for how to choose between sensor A & B.
Option/config to edit user set point list?
Option/config to recalibrate?

Debug:
 - Go to calibrated angle.
 - Go to angle sensor voltage.

Do we care how often relay is switched?
Is changing direction worse? Delay?

Bangâ€“bang control (not PID)

Control assumptions for this relay-controlled hydraulic power wedge:
1. No speed control (relay is only ON/OFF).
1. No overshoot due to inertia (hydraulic damps instantaneously).
1. No error due to disturbances (hydraulic will hold position).
1. Very little delay in measurement.

Issues (more assumptions to think about):
1. Sensor noise should be low because sensor has high resolution in the important range.
1. We do care how often the relay is switched.
1. Relays probably have a minimum on time before any output is seen in angle sensor.
1. Seems to have some overshoot from relay turn off time?
   - Is it consistent?
   - Same in each direction?
   - In high-res (10 deg) range: 0.12V raising, 0.07V lowering.. More (0.20V) at -10 deg end of range!

If angle sensor power input changes, it's output changes wildly so the power wedge goes crazy. Handle this!! *
 - Would help to have control enable have sensor power good as a dependency (required input).
 - No sensor power good, no control. <**
 - **** Next level: Control requires sensor output within range min/max 0.5 - 4.5V. 0V = no control, 5V = no control. ****
 - Error: Sensor bad (sensor reading out of range. No control).
 - Log/count these occurances.
 - Tightly couple/shield/protect sensor power, sensor valid, MCU, control enable, setpoint.
What happens if sensor is disconnected? Do we need a weak pull up/down to detect (and error) sensor disconnected?
 - Each pin: power, read, ground?
Error: sensor value fluctuations (changed too quickly?)

Error: No movement when relay on.
Error: Relay on too long. No control.
 - Max vs. typical?
Error: High relay cycles. No control.

Error sensors diverged (diff > threshold)
