Add go-off-the-map ability for both high and low ends of the range.
- Use state machine? states:
  SENSOR_GOOD: Position is within reable sensor
  OFF_MAP_HIGH_REQUESTED_BUT_WERE_NOT_AT_END_OF_SENSOR: Need to drive normally until we reach maxSetpoint
  OFF_MAP_HIGH_REQUESTED_AND_AT_MAX_SETPOINT:
  DRIVING_OFF_MAP_HIGH_FOR_SPECIFIC_TIME
  OFF_THE_MAP_HIGH

TODO Overdrive is not saved in EEPROM so it will perform the overdrive on each reboot if the wedge is in overdrive position.
     Because go to saved setpoint is called on boot and the current setpoint includes an overdrive.
